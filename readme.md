What could you do, if you were severely limited? What would you build, if you had a basic understanding of HTML, and not much more? I've always wanted to have a clean, minimalistic personal blog, where I can post my thoughts. However, I wanted to build it myself.

This website is the result of my initial efforts. In the process of making it, I also decided to make [blogby](https://github.com/bcionescu/blogby), a static blog generator, using only HTML and CSS.

This version of the site currently includes some vanilla JS, but once I have a basic version of blogby up and running, I aim to only use HTML and CSS.
