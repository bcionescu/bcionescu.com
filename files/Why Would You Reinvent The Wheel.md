It is a fair question. Why *would* you do that? For example, this blog, which you are currently looking at, was designed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a sprinkling of vanilla JS—that's it!

Why not use the myriad of other tools available to achieve this? The answer is simple: I was curious. If I had to create this blog from scratch, how would *I* do it? What makes up a blog? Do I need all of the features that generally come with one?

You see, the internet is bloated; it's become nearly impossible to navigate. This is due to the large amounts of ever-present ads and heavy JS used seemingly everywhere.

I wanted something clean and simple, light as a feather—a delight to gaze upon. This is how I felt when I found the blogs of [DHH](https://world.hey.com/dhh) and [Jason Fried](https://world.hey.com/jason). The design of [hey.com/world](https://www.hey.com/world/) is excellent; clean and easy to read.

I wanted to build something similar, but with meaningful constraints, as that is where exploratory learning usually works best; bonus points if you have minimal knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Despite my lack of knowledge, I had the basic template up and running within a few hours. I had a nice clean background colour, some elements, a nice container for my text, a beautiful font, and some pretty CSS to tie it all together. A bit of troubleshooting also ensured that my blog looks essentially the same on mobile, which is fantastic. I was not expecting it to be so easy.

Now, what's next? Well, I love writing in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I have it set up just the way I like it; customised to the gills. The result of a writing session is a small .md file. As a result, the next step is to write a program that converts my Markdown file to HTML.

There's probably some library I could use, which does that for me, but again, what would be the fun in that? I want to suffer a bit, explore, come across dead ends; all for that sweet-sweet reward at the end, where I finally figure it out.
