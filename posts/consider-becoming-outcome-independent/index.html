    <p>They say that outcome independence is to accept loss; however, does it have to be this way? Power is important, as it gives you options.</p>

    <p>So, how do you get it? You place yourself in a position where you win—no matter what happens. You might say that this is a cynical view, but we live in a cynical world.</p>

    <p>YouTube is a fantastic example of this. YouTube is just a platform. It does not have to generate any content. It does not need to film, edit, or publish anything. It leaves this to the creators.</p>

    <p>When a human makes a video and uploads it, YouTube figures out if there is an audience for it. If there is, it will promote the video to said audience.</p>

    <p>Even if the revenue on that video is a few dollars, YouTube wins. Why? Because it has millions of creators.</p>

    <p>A human wrote, recorded, and then edited the video. This may have taken hours or even days. As long as the video makes <i>some</i> money, YouTube wins.</p>

    <p>This is a fantastic position to be in, as you should aim to place yourself in a similar position. My <a href="https://youtube.com/@bcionescu" class="body-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a> is a perfect example of this.</p>

    <p>On top of my usual rants, I also post computer-related tutorials. I really like computers, and I like to use niche software that many people will never hear about.</p>

    <p>If my YouTube channel is a success in itself, that’s great. More independence for me. If it is not, I can mention my tutorials on my CV. If a potential employee checks out my videos, they will see that they are polished, well-produced, that I excel at communication, that I am knowledgeable, and that I am (sometimes) funny.</p>

    <p>Additionally, I like to write. Right now, I’m about to publish my first Sci-Fi novel, called <a href="https://dl.bookfunnel.com/u32npyhm6k" class="body-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protectorate</a>. If the book does well, fantastic! I get to live in a cabin in the woods and write all day. If not, a potential employer will see the book and know that I can do quality work over a long period of time.</p>

    <p>Win-win!</p>
