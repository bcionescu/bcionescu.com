		<p>It is a fair question. Why <i>would</i> you do that? For example, this blog, which you are currently looking at,
			was
			designed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a sprinkling of vanilla JS—that's it!
			<br><br>
			Why not use the myriad of other tools available to achieve this? The answer is simple: I was curious. If I had to
			create this blog from scratch, how would <i>I</i> do it? What makes up a blog? Do I need all of the features that
			generally come with one?
			<br><br>
			You see, the internet is bloated; it's become nearly impossible to navigate. This is due to the large amounts of
			ever-present ads and heavy JS used seemingly everywhere.
			<br><br>
			I wanted something clean and simple, light as a feather—a delight to gaze upon. This is how I felt when I found
			the blogs of <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh" class="body-link" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer">DHH</a> and <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason" class="body-link" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Fried</a>. The design of <a href="https://www.hey.com/world/" class="body-link"
				target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hey.com/world</a> is excellent; clean and easy to
			read.
			<br><br>
			I wanted to build something similar, but with meaningful constraints, as that is where exploratory learning
			usually works best; bonus points if you have minimal knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
			<br><br>
			Despite my lack of knowledge, I had the basic template up and running within a few hours. I had a nice clean
			background colour, some elements, a nice container for my text, a beautiful font, and some pretty CSS to tie it
			all together. A bit of troubleshooting also ensured that my blog looks essentially the same on mobile, which is
			fantastic. I was not expecting it to be that easy.
			<br><br>
			Now, what's next? Well, I love writing in <a href="https://obsidian.md" class="body-link" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a>. I have it set up
			just the way I like
			it; customised to the
			gills. The result of a writing session is a small .md file; therefore, the next step is to write a program that
			converts my Markdown file to HTML.
			<br><br>
			There's probably some library I could use, which does that for me, but again, what would be the fun in that? I
			want to suffer, explore, come across dead ends; all for that sweet-sweet reward, where I
			finally—figure it out.
