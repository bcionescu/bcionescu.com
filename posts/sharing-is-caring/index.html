			<p>The other day, I came up with a really nice config for Obsidian. I found incredibly useful plugins, tweaked the CSS just right, and set up the perfect hotkeys for my setup.</p>

			<p>I remember smiling from ear to ear as I turned around to show someone; however, there was nobody there. I was alone, in my room, and I realized that most of my friends are normies, and so theyâ€™re not into this kind of stuff.</p>

			<p>For a while now, I had been toying with the idea of starting a new YouTube channel, specifically about tech stuff like Vim, Bash, mechanical keyboards, Obsidian, etc., all wrapped up in a nice ASMR package.</p>

			<p>Finally, the time has come, and <a href="https://youtu.be/6tsuMWAarqo" class="body-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my first video</a> is already getting a bit of attention, which is quite heartening. It means that people are finding value in it, and that makes me very happy.</p>

			<p>I know that we should not seek happiness or validation from externals, but man, it feels good just the same.</p>
