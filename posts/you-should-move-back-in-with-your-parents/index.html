  <p>All bets are off; you should move back in with your parents if you can.</p>

  <p>I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but the economy is demolished. Very few companies are hiring, and some of the existing job listings appear to be fake; put up by companies in an attempt to appear more profitable than they actually are.</p>

  <p>If you want to be free, you need to figure out how to do your own things, instead of following advice that has been repeated adnauseaum by people who do not have your best interest in mind.</p>

  <p>Moving in with family won’t be free. You’ll need to help out, either by chipping in or helping out with occasional tasks, etc. However, you will save a bunch of money.</p>

  <p>Is living with family so unbearable that you’d rather give thousands of dollars every month to a stranger? For some of you, maybe; however, for most of you, that is doubtful.</p>

  <p>After spending three months gallivanting through Norway, I flew back to Romania to spend some time with family. My grandparents are getting older, and even though I’m lucky enough to still have three of them around, they’re all in their eighties. One of them is eighty-six. They won’t be around forever, I know it, and they know it.</p>

  <p>These are the last years that I’ll get to spend with them, and the savings? That’s just the cherry on top.</p>
