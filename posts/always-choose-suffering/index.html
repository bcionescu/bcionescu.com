		<p>In Eastern Europe, the default type of humour is that of the dark variety. This may become evident, once you consider the deeply troubled history of said corner of Europe. I remember this very vividly <a href="../posts/of-stimuli" class="body-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing up</a>. Whenever something bad happened, people would always laugh. Not because it was necessarily funny, but because the alternative was unacceptable.</p>

		<p>The idea that life contains much suffering is not only accepted, but woven into the culture itself. Many people born in such circumstances understand that suffering is not only unavoidable, but to be sought out; that you should always choose the hard path.</p>

		<p>On an ideal day, I begin by doing two things: I go out for a long walk/hike first thing in the morning, and then I take a cold shower for two to three minutes. The cold water is both scary and exhilarating, both painful and joyful at the same time.</p>

		<p>As the deluge of icy cold water whips my skin, I find myself questioning my decision, and tensing up my body, only to find myself laughing moments later. If I could see myself at that moment, I know that my face would radiate pure joy—not <i>despite</i> the suffering, but <i>because</i> of it.</p>

		<p>The relationship between suffering and joy also shows up when I'm doing something physically demanding, like walking up a very tall and steep hill. I start to breathe heavily as I inch closer to the top, only to find myself smiling once I get over it.</p>

		<p>That same relationship is not always obvious when it comes to other pursuits, such as getting better at programming.</p>

		<p>I <i>really</i> <a href="https://github.com/bcionescu" class="body-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enjoy programming</a>. It allows me to express myself in a way that no other medium permits. However, this does not mean that every moment has to be enjoyable. Occasionally I come across a concept, or a problem, and I get stuck. This becomes frustrating, and suffering begins. After a while I figure out the solution, solve the problem, and then—bliss.</p>

		<p>If I avoided the suffering part, instead of understanding that it is necessary, I would never get to savour the feeling of bliss.</p>

		<p>This next part is for me, as well as for the reader. Always remember that the easy path is actually the hard part in disguise. Whenever presented with a choice, always choose suffering.</p>
