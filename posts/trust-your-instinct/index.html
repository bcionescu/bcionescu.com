  <p>Some people claim that you should never trust your instinct, and that pure rationality is the only way. Are they right?</p>

  <p>You have a supercomputer between your ears. It is called your subconscious mind, and it is <i>very</i> powerful. It is so powerful that you are unable to fully grasp it with your conscious mind.</p>

  <p>The subconscious mind examines petabytes of data every second, in the form of sensory information and background tasks.</p>

  <p>This part of your mind is analyzing your environment constantly, on top of making sure your body keeps functioning, without you having to think about it.</p>

  <p>In fact, you do not have root access to your brain. You wouldn’t be able to stop various bodily functions even if you thought about it really hard.</p>

  <p>One of the most magical aspects of the subconscious mind is that the longer you live, the more you train it.</p>

  <p>Have you ever received an offer from someone, and something about it told you it was too good to be true? That’s your subconscious mind telling you something, and you should listen to it.</p>

  <p>Evolutionary pressures over countless years have trained that part of your mind to recognize danger, and you have it because your ancestors had it.</p>

  <p>Those who had better instincts lived and procreated, leading up to you and me. You can call it genetic memory, your gut, or whatever you wish.</p>

  <p>No matter what you call it, one fact remains: you ignore your instinct at your own peril.</p>
