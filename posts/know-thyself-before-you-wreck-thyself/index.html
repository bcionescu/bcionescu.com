  <p>They say that knowledge is power, and boy, are they right.</p>

  <p>Here’s an unintuitive truth: Life is more about avoiding disasters than making good decisions. You can make all the right decisions: brush your teeth twice a day, save your money, and donate to those in need. However, if you drink a bit too much one evening and get behind the wheel of a car, you can throw it all away.</p>

  <p>When I started freelancing back in 2017, I began ordering takeaway. I was working a lot, and <i>I deserved it</i>, or so I thought. The next thing I knew, I packed on far too many pounds. Years later, I’m still paying for that mistake, as I work every day to achieve an optimal weight.</p>

  <p>All it takes is one spur-of-the-moment decision, and you’re in trouble. That’s how life works, and this is not something that is truly advertised to you when you’re young.</p>

  <p>It should be.</p>

  <p>Optimize your environment for good decisions. Stay away from temptations and bad people. Avoid consumerism and those who tout it as a panacea. Read books written by people who lived thousands of years ago, who had little to no financial gain from sharing their wisdom.</p>

  <p>Make good decisions, and your life will (likely) be good.</p>
