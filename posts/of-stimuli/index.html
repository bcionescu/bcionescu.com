			<p>The ability to pay attention is a superpower; however, this was not always the case. I recall growing up in rural Romania in the 90s. Looking back, my upbringing was drastically different from that of kids growing up today.</p>

			<p>Boredom was an ever-present weight. If I turned on the TV, I had access to three channels, one of which I could not understand, as it was in Bulgarian. Most of the daytime shows were boring, so that was a no-go.</p>

			<p>The second-easiest source of stimulation was looking through my grandparents' books, but even though I was able to read them, I was far too young to understand or appreciate their contents. Greek myths who? I wanted fun.</p>

			<p>The only real source of stimulation was playing outside, usually with other kids. Riding my one-speed communist-era bicycle down a hill as fast as possible, often nearly into incoming traffic, falling off it and getting hurt, all of it was done to abate boredom.</p>

			<p>As time passed, I grew a bit older and discovered that books were great fun. Even though social media was starting to emerge, I had already passed the point where it could completely take over my life.</p>

			<p>Fast-forward to today. I am in my early 30s, and I have a superpower. Unlike many others, I can sit down and read a book without it feeling torturous. I often go on three or four-hour walks, and I spend the entire time either inside my head, thinking, or meditating, and clearing my mind.</p>

			<p>I don't listen to music or even audiobooks when on walks. Instead, I do my best to exist in the moment. The more people I interact with, the more I understand how rare this is.</p>

			<p>Not looking at my phone constantly and not requiring instant stimulation all the time enables me to sit down and focus on something for an extended period. Recently, I decided to take learning programming seriously and make significant progress.</p>

			<p>I joined <a href="https://www.boot.dev/u/bcionescu" class="body-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boot.dev</a>, and within a few days, I blitzed through a good portion of the material, often going at it for multiple hours at a time. Not many people can do this, so I strive to develop this skill.</p>

			<p>I do my best to stay away from easy stimulation. I don't scroll through social media, I don't mindlessly watch YouTube, I rarely listen to music, and I seldom play any video games.</p>

			<p>Instead, I go for long walks, train my body, practice physical flexibility, read, learn, and mindfully consume content that is good for me.</p>

			<p>This may seem boring from the outside, as if I'm missing out on things. On the contrary, I am finally starting to live my life to the fullest.</p>
