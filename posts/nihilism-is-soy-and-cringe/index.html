<p>What matters is what is useful, not what is true.</p>

<p>When I was young, I was definitely nihilistic and edgy, in a Rick and Morty kind of way.</p>

<i>Nothing matters, dude.</i>
<p>I wonder if the people who make those shows truly have your best interest at heart? Do they want you to live a good life, or do they want you to watch their show and buy their merch?</p>

<p>There is, of course, an element of this with everyone who creates content. After all, we all need to make money; however, morals vary.</p>

<p>Returning to my main point, the older I get, the more I realise that what is useful matters far more than what is true.</p>

<p>Life is, to some degree, about cope.</p>

<p>Believing that nothing matters does not serve you in any way, and living your life as if this were true will only serve to harm you.</p>

<p>Whether the afterlife or reincarnation is real is less important than the fact that those beliefs can make your life better. They can bring you joy and peace, something that the truth rarely does.</p>

<p>There’s a reason why truth is often described as cold and hard.</p>

<p>Nihilism is a trap, relegating you to apathy. My point is not that you should live in a fantasy world, but that you should curate your belief system, pick and choose what works for you.</p>

<p>This is the antidote to apathy. Make small changes every day, learn, and decide to believe that which serves you.</p>
