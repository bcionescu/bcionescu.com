    <i>And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music</i> - Nietzsche, probably.
    <p>Growing up, my Gen X parents told me that you <i>have</i> to go to University. To be fair, that’s what their parents told <i>them</i>, and for a while, that worked.</p>

    <p>However, time marches on, and things change. I graduated University with only a small amount of debt, thankfully, and I never got to use my Diploma. In fact, I never even picked it up.</p>

    <p>It’s time to become a little bit unhinged, and to begin to disregard that which you have been told throughout your life. The world is changing, and if you keep following the old rules, you’re going to be in trouble.</p>
