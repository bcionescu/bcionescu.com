  <p>I recently spoke about how <a href="https://youtu.be/O9UWhLc7fLs" class="body-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people now sound like AI</a>. After pondering the issue further, I came to a scary realization that I, too, am permeable and thus susceptible to this.</p>

  <p>A while ago, I ended up looking up commonly used AI words, like: delve, boast, meticulous, etc., so I could avoid them. I now find myself generally avoiding scripted videos, as they might have used AI for the script.</p>

  <p>Even if they did not, many people now sound like AI, and I’m trying to minimize my exposure to it. I don’t want to sound like a machine; I want to sound like a human. I want to stutter and make mistakes.</p>

  <p>In old Sci-Fi books, the robots always envied us. Our imperfection was what made us humans, and in stories like Asimov’s <i>Bicentennial Man</i>, the robots seek imperfection to become more like us.</p>

  <p>Especially as someone who <a href="https://dl.bookfunnel.com/u32npyhm6k" class="body-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes fiction</a>, I don’t want my writing to be robotic. I want it to be perfect, but what that means seems to be changing.</p>

  <p>Perfection is sterile and clinical. Nature is imperfect, and yet it’s all I’ve ever wanted.</p>
