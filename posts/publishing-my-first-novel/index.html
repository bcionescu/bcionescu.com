	<b><p>December 20, 2025</p></b>

  <p>Over the last six months, I’ve been working on my first Sci-Fi novel. If you want to be an ARC reader, you can <a href="https://dl.bookfunnel.com/u32npyhm6k" class="body-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grab a free copy</a> of it before it goes live on the 2nd of January, 2026.</p>

  <p>Here’s the blurb.</p>

  <p>Turning the tin around, I can see the name Adam—my name—etched into the back. This is a dangerous thing to do, but it is my way of silently fighting back. If one knows that he is not allowed a name, like an animal in a factory farm, inevitably, he finds one for himself.</p>

  <p>Set deep underneath California, centuries after a cataclysmic event, <i>Protectorate</i> is the story of citizen A-376, who is tasked with rooting out a rebel faction that threatens to end the life of everyone he has ever known.</p>

  <p>His reward? A life extension which would allow him to live past the age of twenty-eight.</p>
